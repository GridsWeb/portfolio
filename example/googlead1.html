<!-- Help me to write html code to display ads from Google Ads to earn money from ads. -->

<!-- To display ads from Google Ads on your website and earn money from them, you need to follow a few steps. 
    Here's a basic HTML code example to get you started: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
  <!-- Add Google Ads script -->
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({
      google_ad_client: "YOUR_AD_CLIENT_ID",
      enable_page_level_ads: true
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your website content -->
  <h1>Welcome to googlead1</h1>
  <p>This is a sample page where Google Ads will be displayed.</p>
  
  <!-- Ad unit placement -->
  <div>
    <!-- Replace 'YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID' with your actual ad slot ID -->
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block"
         data-ad-client="YOUR_AD_CLIENT_ID"
         data-ad-slot="YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID"
         data-ad-format="auto"
         data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Load Google Ads -->
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Replace "YOUR_AD_CLIENT_ID" with your actual AdSense client ID. You can find this ID in your Google AdSense account.

2. Replace "YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID" with your ad slot ID. An ad slot ID refers to a specific ad unit you create in your AdSense account. 
You can create ad units for different sizes and formats.

3. Place the Google Ads script in the <head> section of your HTML document. This script is responsible for loading the Google Ads library.

4. Place the ad unit placement code where you want the ads to appear on your website. 
This code uses the <ins> tag with specific attributes to define the ad unit's characteristics.

5. Finally, load the Google Ads by calling (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}) in the <script> section. 
    This line of code tells Google to display the ads on your webpage.

Remember to comply with Google AdSense policies and guidelines to ensure a smooth and successful integration. 
Additionally, you may need to sign up for an AdSense account and get your website approved before displaying ads. -->
