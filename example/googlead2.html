<!-- Help me to write html code to display ads from Google Ads to earn money from ads. -->

<!-- Sure! To display ads from Google Ads on your website and earn money, you can use Google AdSense. 
  Here's an example of HTML code you can use to integrate Google AdSense ads into your web page: -->

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>Your Website</title>
    <!-- Add the Google AdSense script -->
    <script data-ad-client="YOUR_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID" async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Place the ad code where you want the ads to appear -->
    <div id="ad-container">
      <ins class="adsbygoogle"
           style="display:block"
           data-ad-client="YOUR_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID"
           data-ad-slot="YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID"
           data-ad-format="auto"
           data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
      <script>
           (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
      </script>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
    <h1>Welcome to googlead2</h1>
    <p>This is the content of my website.</p>
    
    <!-- Other sections of your website -->
    
  </body>
  </html>  

<!-- To use this code, you need to replace YOUR_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID with your own AdSense client ID and YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID with the ad slot ID for the specific ad unit you want to display. 
  You can obtain these values from your Google AdSense account.

The code creates a container <div> with the ID ad-container where the ad will be displayed. 
  The Google AdSense script is included in the <head> section of the HTML file. 
    Inside the container, an <ins> element is used to define the ad unit, and the JavaScript code adsbygoogle.push({}) is used to load and display the ad.

Remember to comply with Google AdSense policies and guidelines to ensure a smooth experience with ads on your website. -->
